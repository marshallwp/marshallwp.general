bugfixes:
  - deps_mgr - all repository management types now require `name` and ensure it is mapped to a parameter. i.e., the previously documented behavior is now enforced.

minor_changes:
  - deps_mgr - added the new variable `deps_mgr_package_default_state`, which allows users to set the default state for simple packages.

trivial:
  - deps_mgr - add integration tests.

release_summary: deps_mgr - Reduced duplicative labels, fixed issues with repository name, added an option to change the default package state, and added integration tests.
