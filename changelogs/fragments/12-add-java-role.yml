minor_changes:
  - deps_mgr - will now gather required facts (and only those facts) if they are missing. This will allow the role to work if the playbook has``gather_facts: false`` or an incompatible ``gather_subset`` setting.
  - deps_mgr - alpine repositories now support copying the public key from the controller instead of downloading from a URL.

doc_changes:
  - deps_mgr - updated the README.md to fix spelling and formatting errors.
