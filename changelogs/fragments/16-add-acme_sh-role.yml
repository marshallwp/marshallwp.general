release_summary: Add a role to manage acme.sh and fix a few documentation issues.

major_changes:
  - Add ``acme_sh`` role - this role allows you to install/update/remove, configure, and schedule [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh).
    acme.sh is a certificate manager written purely in Shell and thus has minimal dependencies (wget or curl). It is highly extensible and works on just
    about anything.

trivial:
  - Updated the README of deps_mgr to fix broken links and add details about where to find info on ansible os_family values.
