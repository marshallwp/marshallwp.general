marshallwp.general dirtree Role
========================

Creates a directory tree from a dictionary of dictionaries. Lets you declare such a tree in an intuitive hierarchial manner instead of a flat list of paths.

Requirements
------------
<!-- Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required. -->

None. All needed ansible modules are in `ansible.builtin`, all python plugins are included in this module, and those plugins depend entirely on builtin python libraries.

Role Variables
--------------

| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| dirtree_root | The root directory the dirtree will be created in | `/` |
| dirtree_owner | The owner of created directories.  Passed directly to `ansible.builtin.file` | `ansible_user_id` |
| dirtree_group | The group of created directories.  Passed directly to `ansible.builtin.file` | `ansible_user_gid` |
| dirtree_mode | The permissions the resulting directories should have. Can be set as octals or in symbolic mode. | |
| dirtree_tree | The nested dictionary defining the directory tree. | |

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- name: Create Directory Tree Under /tmp
  hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: marshallwp.general.dirtree
      dirtree_root: /tmp
      dirtree_tree:
        dir1:
          subdir_lvl1:
            subdir_lvl2:
              - subdir_lvllast
        dir2:
          subdir1_lvl1:
          subdir2_lvl2:
            subdir_lvllast:
        dir3_lvllast:
```

Another way to consume this role would be:

```yaml
- name: Create Directory Tree Under ~
  hosts: servers
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Trigger invocation of run role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: marshallwp.general.dirtree
      vars:
        dirtree_root: ~
        dirtree_tree:
          dir1:
            subdir_lvl1:
              subdir_lvl2:
                - subdir_lvllast
          dir2:
            subdir1_lvl1:
            subdir2_lvl2:
              subdir_lvllast:
          dir3_lvllast:
```
